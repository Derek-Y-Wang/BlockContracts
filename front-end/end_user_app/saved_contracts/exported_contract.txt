b'   through the trailer there is evidence that the game tries to avoid being repetitive by\nmaking enemies unique and have distinct personality, and while that does work, it\'s best\nnot to make each one of them unique, but rather have a general theme. Undertale, the game\nmentioned in the kickstarter, does as such. The enemies in undertale though are all unique,\naren\'t different among same enemies, such as the froggit you encounter earlier is not different\nfrom the one you encounter later. There\'s only a handfull of enemies that have fleshed out chara-\ncters, basically avoid having too many distinct characters, because that can tire out the player.\nTherefor, in my opinion, have a few really special characters with a bit more work on characteristic,\nbut have your general enemies act simple but with small twists, like not taking itself seriously, being\noverly cocky or cute. Undertale\'s enemies is a nice study, it does that pretty nicely, but you can also\nlook at the magicka 2\'s civilians that basically talk shit to the protagonist any time possible.\n\nThe environment also seems to be mainly focused in a lab, and that can become boring at times\nso make sure to change things up a bit, even if its just changing a color theme, because even that\ncan have big changes to the tone of the environment. Undertale goes a bit more on this mostly be-\ncause toby had time, but if you want to keep it easier Oneshot can be a great example, most of the\nenvironment is just colors with little snippets of other things to give a different feeling.\n\nTry to have little "side quests" that can really add personality to 2D pixel adventure games like this.\nthese side quests can either have huge impact on the game, in the case of undertale, or little impact,\nin the case of Oneshot (don\'t spoil on second run). They help build the world around the player, and\nmake the player feel like this isn\'t just something they\'re walking around. There is a picture in the kickstarter\nwhere the player talks to the protagonists little brother, which is nice indeed, but don\'t forget to help\nbuild not only the protagonist\'s character but also this new world around him/her/it(whatever it is idc)\n\nCharacter design is also something that\'s needs slight improvement, but honestly if the character\ntraits are well done then this shouldn\'t be a big issue. Nevertheless, it\'s better to have each character\nlook slightly different then just: different face on white trench coat. You can make certain characters\nfatter, taller, wear different stuff, or even have different skin color, it doesn\'t have to be irl like, such as\nwhite, yellow, black, it can be green or blue which might be weird but as long as it makes sense in\nthe world it will do.\n\nWould like to take the time to just compliment the fighting mechanics, it looks absolutely amazing and\nif you can work around it and make every battle feel different, like have the keys fly off in different directions\nor remember a pattern then turn dark and hit to a beat heard earlier, it would be fantastic.\n\nFinally, a story. Though your game has a story, i can tell that it\'s not what just is on the surface. There\'s\na lot of potential here for interesting dilemmas for the player to explore. A well made story is crucial\nfor these type of games. Undertale and Oneshot work because the story is interesting with well established\ncharacters, and a conflict for players to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S hit me up i want help lol this looks amazing\n
