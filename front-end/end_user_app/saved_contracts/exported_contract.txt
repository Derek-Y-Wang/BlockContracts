b'Warning: There will be lots of spoilers ahead!\nFirst, I\'m so excited! Parasite is the only Bong Joon-ho flick I\'ve watched (so far) and it was, to put it mildly, amazing. \n\nHoo boy, right off the bat this soundtrack is dark and tense and I love it. \n\nBased off the TV series\' adverts telling me, "Snowpiercer is all that\'s left of the world," I admittedly had an inkling that this was coming. Still, what an awesome (albeit terrifying) premise.\n\nI get the feeling I am about to regret saying this, but as someone who plays a musical instrument for fun, it would be kind of nice if more people asked. \n\nYou go, guy! You fight against the patriarchy! \n\nIs Chris Evans\' natural hair brown? Darkness and dirty aside, he looks good. \n\nOh hi, Octavia Spencer! Damn, I really slept on this movie. \n\nBah, even in Snowpiercer there\'s quarantine. \n\nIs she...tasting her own blood? Yeah, screw these people. \n\nOkay, I had heard that people got their arms frozen/hammered off in this movie \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9d but even this prior knowledge did not make this any easier to watch. Yikes. \n\nTo quote Rachel from Friends: "Well, what if I don\'t want to be a shoe? What if I wanna be a purse or a hat?" \n
